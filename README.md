# Fastbreak Truck Kata

IMPORTANT! All the starting information was provided by my teacher before doing the exam. (UML, userstories, etc.)

Repository for my solution to the kata of fast break truck that our teacher "designed" for us.

Solution of my teacher: [dfleta](https://github.com/dfleta/fastbreaktruck)

## Description

This app is a Truck that create breakfasts. There are two types of it:

* Eyeholes: that contains 2 items. Eyeholes and Turbulen Juice
* Smiggles: that contains 2 items. Smiggles and Fleeb Juice

There is also an optional action to add a new toy to the breakfast, but it is too expensive...so I do not recommend it.

## Keywords

* OpenClosePrinciple

## UML

There is the last user stroy missing, the Plumbus class. That should be added to the UML
